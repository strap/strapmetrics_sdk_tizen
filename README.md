##Strap Metrics Tizen SDK Quick Start Guide


We now support both Tizen JS apps and provider apps for Android. Strap Metrics utilizes Sockets to communicate between the watch and the connected phone, and tries to be smart about how often it sends data in order to preserve battery life.

Getting started with the Strap Metrics SDK is pretty straightforward. These steps shouldn't take more than 15-20 minutes.
